/**
 * Migration registry invariant guard.
 *
 * Usage: node tests/run-electron-node-test.cjs tests/migration-registry.test.ts
 *
 * runMigrations() takes its target from the array tail, not from the maximum
 * version (main/db.ts), and nothing asserted that the array is well formed. A
 * registry that is duplicated, out of order, or missing its tail entry is an
 * unrecoverable upgrade-bricking mode: the tail target is what the app reports
 * as its supported version, and the run loop applies only entries above the
 * database's current version, so a bad registry silently produces a
 * half-migrated database.
 *
 * The obvious runtime fix — targeting Math.max — is deliberately NOT what this
 * change does. If the array were ever non-monotonic, Math.max would select a
 * target no migration reaches and the run would silently no-op, replacing
 * today's loud SchemaVersionMismatchError with a quiet half-migrated database.
 * The assertion is the fix; the execution change is a separate decision.
 *
 * The snapshot below is taken at module load, before anything can mutate the
 * exported array. That matters: tests/inventory-ledger.test.ts reassigns
 * MIGRATIONS in place to build upgrade fixtures, which is precisely why this
 * invariant must not also be enforced from inside runMigrations(), where it
 * would run against a truncated registry.
