/**
 * Receipt column oracle.
 *
 * Answers one question by measurement instead of by argument: how many display
 * columns does each print path actually render, per paper size and per template?
 *
 * The measurement never reads a production width constant. It walks the emitted
 * ESC/POS bytes, consumes the command bytes the way a printer's command parser
 * would, and counts printable bytes into the printer's character grid, scaling
 * by the character-size width in effect at the time each byte is written. The
 * rendered full-width rule is the stream's own statement of the budget it laid
 * out for, so its cell count is a measurement of the output rather than a
 * restatement of the `columns` argument the caller passed in. A test that
 * recomputed the production width expression would pass for exactly the wrong
 * constant, so nothing here imports a width helper.
 *
 * Every configuration is also pinned to a golden block in
 * tests/fixtures/receipt-columns/golden-receipt-columns-v1.txt, so a future
 * width change shows up as a reflowed receipt diff instead of a bare number.
 *
 * This suite measures and reports. It does not decide what a receipt should be
 * allowed to be: no production width is changed here, and the 80mm divergence
 * between the two paths is recorded as a measured fact with the decision left
 * open.
