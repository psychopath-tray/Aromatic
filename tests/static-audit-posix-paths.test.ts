 * Regression guard for the class of defect behind the Windows static-audit
 * failures: a host-native path compared against a forward-slash literal.
 * `path.relative` returns backslashes on Windows, so an unconverted comparison
 * missed every allowlist entry there. The audits failed on an intentionally
 * reviewed file in one suite and silently skipped a guard in another, both green
 * on macOS and Linux. Only the Windows CI job saw it.
 *
 * These cases are pure string checks, so they run - and fail - on every host.

 * else. Parsing the block headers against a literal `\n` found nothing in a CRLF
 * file, so every title parsed as the whole block and every configuration read as
 * missing from the golden. The fixture is the canonical LF form, so the parser
 * has to reach the same blocks from the CRLF form the Windows runner supplies.
 *
 * Both forms are derived from whichever one the checkout produced, so this case
 * is the same on every host: on Windows the file is already CRLF and on Linux it
 * is already LF, and either way the parser is asked for both.
