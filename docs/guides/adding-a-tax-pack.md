# Adding a tax pack

How to produce a country tax pack and get it published. The pack schema, the trust model, and the
install path are in the [tax pack reference](../reference/tax-packs.md); how the engine applies a
pack is in [taxation](../architecture/taxation.md). This page is the procedure only and carries no
field tables.

Adding a pack needs maintainer coordination. Open a proposal issue before authoring one, and
describe the jurisdiction, the authoritative sources, and the test vectors you intend to provide.

## 1. Establish the authoritative source

Tax rules must be backed by an official tax authority, enacted legislation, or official
administrative guidance. A blog post, a summary, or a generated answer is not a primary source.

Record the specific instrument, not the topic: the statute section, the rate schedule, the effective
date. A pack that cites "VAT in Europe" is unusable; a pack that cites the exact schedule with its
publication reference is auditable.

Aromatic is software, not certified legal or tax advice. The disclaimer in the contribution terms is
part of the deliverable, not a formality.

## 2. Scope the jurisdiction

State the geographic and legal scope explicitly in the pack, not in prose around it:

- Country-wide or a subset of states or provinces.
- Whether a rule distinguishes interstate from intrastate supply.
- The effective date, and whether a previous rate is retained under `effectiveTo`.
- The currency, and whether it differs from the pack's country.

Set `jurisdiction` precisely. A pack that claims a scope it does not implement will misprice
stores that install it, which is worse than the pack not existing.

## 3. Write the pack as data

Author a `CountryPack` JSON document. Verify every field against
`main/tax-packs/types.ts` and the field list in the
[tax pack reference](../reference/tax-packs.md). A pack that will not satisfy the types will not
pass activation.

Three things to get right the first time, because each one is enforced:

- **Amounts are strings.** A rate or amount written as a JSON number risks floating-point drift on
  the way in. Write `"rate": "20"`.
- **Every line kind needs a default category.** `defaultCategories` must resolve for `product`,
  `packaging`, `delivery`, `service_charge`, and `addon`, and `unclassifiedCategoryId` must name a
  category that exists.
- **Every category and rule needs a label.** Check 21 rejects a pack whose labels are empty, and
  those labels are what a merchant sees in the UI.

Declare rounding deliberately. `taxRounding` and `payableRounding` are separate policies, and the
payable increment is what a customer is actually charged, so copy the jurisdiction's cash rules
rather than assuming they match the tax rounding.

## 4. Set publisher and sourceType

- `publisher` identifies the author. **Never set `publisher: 'local'`.** That value is reserved for
  packs the app synthesizes from settings, and a downloaded artifact claiming it is refused at
  install.
- `sourceType` is `official` when the pack follows an official source and `community` when it is
  built from public information. A `community` pack requires the merchant to acknowledge a
  disclaimer, and check 26 refuses a local pack that claims it.

Never set `taxPoint` to `order_created` expecting a behaviour change. The field is required on the
schema, but nothing reads it; every shipped pack declares `finalized_at` and that is the only value
with any observable meaning.

## 5. Provide test vectors

Give the pack mandatory vectors covering representative transactions. `activationVectorPasses()`
runs them through the real engine at activation, so they are a gate rather than documentation.

Cover at minimum:

- A plain single-category line, at unit, line, and document rounding scope.
- An inclusive-priced line, including one with a fixed component.
- A compounded percent rule with `baseRuleIds`.
- An interstate and an intrastate case, if the pack distinguishes them.
- A customer that is exempt, and a customer carrying a registration number.
- A non-default currency, if the pack targets one.

Include a case whose expected result differs between rounding methods, so the vectors prove the
method is being applied rather than merely accepted.

## 6. Verify locally

Confirm the pack satisfies the schema and the engine before proposing publication:

```sh
npm run test:tax-pack-management
npm run test:tax-pack-catalog
npm run test:tax-engine
```

The pack must also survive `containsUnsafeData()` (check 22) and the registration-number pattern
check (check 25), which rejects nested quantifiers.

## 7. Publish

Packs are published as GitHub releases in the separate
`FreeOpenSourcePOS/Aromatic-Plugins` repository, not in this one. Commit the pack JSON to
`main/tax-packs/` here so the source is versioned with the engine that consumes it.

Then create a release whose tag matches:

```text
tax-pack-<pack-id>-v<X.Y.Z>
```

The `<pack-id>` segment matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` and `<X.Y.Z>` matches `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`. The
format is enforced, not advisory: `scripts/tax-packs/prepare-release.cjs` matches the tag against
`TAG_PATTERN` and throws if it does not conform.

The release process, driven by `.github/workflows/tax-pack-release.yml`:

1. The script resolves the tag to a pack id and version, and verifies the tag version equals the
   version inside the matching pack file. A mismatch throws.
2. It refuses a pack whose `publisher` is `local`.
3. It loads the Ed25519 private key from the `TAX_PACK_SIGNING_KEY` secret and refuses a key that is
   not Ed25519.
4. It computes the SHA-256 digest and the detached base64 signature, then writes a cumulative
   `catalog.json` merging this pack into the previous published catalog.

Aromatic discovers the release by matching that same tag pattern when it pages the Releases API, so a
release whose tag does not match is invisible to every store.

## What not to do

- **Do not ship executable content.** The host never executes pack content. A pack is JSON, and
  check 22 rejects an artifact carrying anything executable or a path value. A pack that needs real
  computation requires an engine change, not a cleverer pack. See
  [0004: data-only tax packs](../decisions/0004-data-only-tax-packs.md).
- **Do not add a key.** One Ed25519 public key is trusted. A second key needs an engine change.
- **Do not add a digest to `LEGACY_TRUSTED_PACK_DIGESTS`.** It is a pinned compatibility list for
  four pre-signing artifacts, not a publishing route.
- **Do not rename a category or rule id** without accepting that check 19 blocks the version, and
  that merchant overrides would have to be remapped.
- **Do not document a behaviour the engine does not have.** A pack cannot make the engine read
  `taxPoint`, target a store, or report by rule.
